    <p>This method identifies ModelSEED reactions that are simlar to each of the reactions input from a metabolic model in KBase. This app is most useful when applied to novel reactions generated in models from the PickAxe app. ModelSEED reactions that are similar to novel reactions from PickAxe can then be applied to identify gene candidates for the novel reaction useing the Find Gene Candidate app.</p>
